# Cloud-Infrastructure-Monitoring-and-Auto-Healing-System
Built a real-time monitoring system using Terraform, AWS CloudWatch, and Lambda to ensure 99.9% uptime of EC2 instances. The system detects failed status checks and automatically reboots the instance using a Python-based Lambda function. Improved resilience of cloud infrastructure with minimal manual intervention.
